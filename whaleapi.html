            <h3>See the whales without the tanks</h3>
            <p>Orcas are among the most intelligent animals on the planet and have captivated us for centuries. With
                their family-oriented and matriachal
                based societies, they are likely to be seen in large groups or pods. These animals are extremely playful,
                engaging in activities such as breaching,
                spyhopping and tail slapping! This app has been created to show the world that these animals are
                accessible to observe without the need of
                tanks and concrete slabs.
